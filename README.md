# TwitterAnalysis
This is a project that can calculate a "happiness score" for each region of the United States based on tweets made in that region.
**Happiness scores are based off of keywords that are completely subjective, this is not the most accurate way to measure happiness**

FOR USE: 
run main.py and enter a file for your tweets, and a file for your keywords. 
sentiment_analysis.py is where all of the happiness scores are computed
